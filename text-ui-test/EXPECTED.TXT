	Hi!, I'm 'Noob'
	What can I do for you?
	__________________________________________________
	I have the following features:
		1. Echo and store three types of tasks: 'todo', 'deadline' and 'event'.
		2. Type "todo" + "taskContent" to record a 'todo' task.
		3. Type "deadline" + "taskContent" + "/by" + "dates/times" to record a 'deadline' task.
		4. Type "event" + "taskContent" + "/from" + "dates/times" + "/to" + "dates/times" to record a 'event' task.
		5. Type "list" to see what I have recorded.
		6. Type "mark" + "number" to mark tasks as done.
		7. Type "unmark" + "number" to mark tasks as not done.
		8. Type "bye" to say goodbye to me.
